## How does a find-replace campaign work?

A find-replace campaign is a campaign that finds all matches of a given string and replaces them with a replacement string.

- Perform a search on Sourcegraph
- In the search results toolbar, click "Find-replace"
- Enter the string to find
- Enter the replacement string
- Once the process is complete, click the notification to open the newly created campaign.
